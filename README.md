# Reproducible-Research
Assignment Course Project 1

This repository contains the used data for the Assignment for Course Project 1, Reproducible Research of the Coursera website. 
The related data set "Activity monitory data" has been downloaded from there and is also included in this repository.

For the 1st Assignment of this course, I added a Rmd.file (markdown-file) and I tried to include all variables such as

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
plus the .csv file.

I explained step-by-step what I did, so hopefully it might be reproducible to you.

The contained markdown-file does not contain the plots, because I am still working on how to implement (or save) plots to a Rmd-File...
